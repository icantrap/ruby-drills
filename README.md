# Ruby Drills

## Introduction
There's plenty of websites that put cute stories behind exercises in the guise of helping you
learn a skill. This project is not that. These are simple skill drills that let you get to the
heart of practicing without the layer of problem solving layered on top. Use this project to
_supplement_ those sites.

## Prerequisites

1. Know how to Github.
1. Know how to install a ruby.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
1. Create a local branch for your work.
1. Install the appropriate ruby.
1. Make your edits.
1. Push your work branch to Github remote.
1. Create a pull request so that others can review your code.

If any of these steps are foreign to you, ask for assistance from your guide.

## Practice

No Googling. These drills are not so complicated that you need to Google for answers. Please
use the ruby-doc for the appropriate ruby version.

Go to the [lib/drills](lib/drills) directory and choose a file. Inside the file will be details
on what is being drilled. Fill in the methods as directed.

If you would like to run a file, try

```shell
  ruby lib/drills/map.rb
```
